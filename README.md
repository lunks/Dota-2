# Dota-2-Reborn
Tracker for issues specific to Linux and Mac in the Reborn client. If you have a general issue or non-system-specific feature request please go to dev.dota2.com

Notes:

* The game requires a 64-bit capable CPU and distribution
* If using nVidia proprietary drivers on Linux, please update to 340.xx or newer before filing a bug report
* If using Mesa on Linux, please update to 10.5.9 or newer before filing a bug report.

If the game fails to launch with a "missing executable" error, please use Steam to [verify the integrity](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335) of the game's files in order to acquire the missing binaries.

Conduct
-------

There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Dota 2 Reborn.  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter a bug while using Dota 2 Reborn, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2-Reborn/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- what platform this is occuring on: Linux or Mac;
- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
- your [system information](#system-information).

Please place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

### System information

Your system information must include:
- your Linux distro or Mac OS version
- if Linux, your Desktop/Window Manager
- if Mac, the model and revision of your hardware
- your Graphics card info (manufacturer, card version), any and all graphics driver versions
- anything else that you think may be useful (mouse/keyboard, filesystem type, etc).

The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`).

Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`.
Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).
